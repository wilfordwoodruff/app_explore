# app_explore
This app runs online and lets you do some exploration across all the writings. We've expanded from the work of several people in past semesters, most noticeably Clara's [Project Map](https://clarabrobergseniorproject.netlify.app/posts/final_project/). As you start thinking about what you can reate and what you want to learn about Pres. Woodruff this can give this can start sparking ideas about places, emotions, and themes he discussed throughout his life.

## Parts you'll need to implement into your own work
It all starts with accessing the Woodruff CSV [https://github.com/wilfordwoodruff/Main-Data/raw/main/data/derived/derived_data.csv](https://github.com/wilfordwoodruff/Main-Data/raw/main/data/derived/derived_data.csv). From here, you can do anything you want! 

## Saving to R Shiny
If you're creating something that just displays what you've found, you don't need to use Shiny. But, if you want to let people explore an interaction or show a new way of seeing Pres. Woodruff's life, Shiny might be able to help you. You can check out Shiny's tutorials [here](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/). Through R, you can run diagrams and dashboards that are hosted on your computer or online. When you start, "Run App" will put it through your computer, but once it's ready you can host it online!

The Papers host their website apps through BYU-Idaho's servers. 
1. If you're a student, you can host it with your personal BYU-I account. Make a pull request to add what you've created, and we'll make sure it's visible to people!
2. If you aren't a student, or haven't made an account, we can do that step for you. Make a pull request with the interactions you've created from your own computer, and we'll publish it through our account to the BYU-I servers.
